Framework is a software suite and production methodology that greatly lowers the bar for the design and construction of freestanding large-scale structures by simultaneously generating both the design and the CNC files necessary to produce a form.

Design Team: Barry Beagen, [David Moses](http://davidmosesprojects.com/), [Trygve Wastvedt](http://trygvewastvedt.com), [Robert White](http://rowhite.com)
